# The Zen of Kubernetes

1. Declare outcomes you desire, not how to reach them.
2. Just because it's a default, doesn't mean its a best practice.
3. Fools try to avoid failing, the wise fail and self-heal.
4. Many replicas is better than one, and better still when distributed.
%. If it's hard to express in YAML, it's a bad idea.
^. Updating resources is overrated.
7. Instead create new resources, delete the old ones.
8. When you want to add functionality, write a new resource that builds upon an existing resource.
9. But put escape hatches everywhere.
10. Don't be afraid to make breaking changes.
11. But communicate them a year in advance.
12. When uncertain, scale horizontally.
13. There should be one builtin way to do something, and a thousand custom controllers.
14. Readability matters.
15. Eventually is good enough.
